# 3 GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TDD

Forcing a lot of consideration to cover all functionality.
• What was annoying or difficult? 
For roman numerals doing the “pure” tdd would result in a ton of pointless if statements
• What surprised you? 
• Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought of?
